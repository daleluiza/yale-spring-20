    <b>The void of self-representation</b><br>
    <br>
    In the mid 1930s the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan proposed a theory called the Mirror Phase. It defined the time when an infant sees its own self in the mirror for the first time and recognizes the image as who they are. It’s a strange
    shock as the image in the mirror doesn’t look like how we feel.<br>
    <br>
    He posits that inside, we are chaotic, ever-changing, raw, a stream of speeding thoughts, desires and images; while outside we are somewhat composed, stable, with relatively symmetrical features and limited communication skills (language).<br>
    <br>
    The image in the mirror is far more one-dimensional than the entity that beholds it. We are the whole and our self-reflection is the lack as it may never represent our authentic, real selves.<br><br>
